## Carbontracker stations selection
There are 246 stations in Carbontracker project by 2018. The station measurement methods include surface-based, shipboard-based, tower-based and aircraft-based. In this analysis, we only focus on data derived from the first three measurements (i.e. aircraft-based measurement is excluded), and in total 200 out of 246 stations are selected. For the stations which have both surface-based and towered-based measurements, we used the surface-based measurements for analysis. For the stations which only have tower-based measurement, we selected the highest measurement.
